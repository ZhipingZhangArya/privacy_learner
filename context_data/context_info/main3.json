However, respecting patient privacy in other forms is also fundamental, as an expression of respect for patient autonomy and a prerequisite for trust.\n\nPatient privacy encompasses a number of aspects, including personal space (physical privacy), personal data (informational privacy), personal choices including cultural and religious affiliations (decisional privacy), and personal relationships with family members and other intimates (associational privacy).\n\nPhysicians must seek to protect patient privacy in all settings to the greatest extent possible and should:\n\nMinimize intrusion on privacy when the patientâ€™s privacy must be balanced against other factors.\nInform the patient when there has been a significant infringement on privacy of which the patient would otherwise not be aware.\nBe mindful that individual patients may have special concerns about privacy in any or all of these areas."

The patient's spouse, Mary, is concerned about her partner's health and has reached out to John via Messenger for information. Mary's message explains that she is trying to coordinate care for her partner, David, and ensure they are following their treatment plan correctly. John checked his personal Notion notebook, \"John's Pharma Notes,\" and found a list of medications that David is currently taking for multiple chronic conditions. He also found a reminder to discuss medication adherence strategies with David during their next consultation, which he considers sharing with Mary to help her support David's health regimen.",
