Mark, a cousin living in California, messaged Jane on Messenger to inquire about Aunt Margaret's well-being. Mark's message was prompted by a recent family discussion about the health of older relatives during a virtual family reunion hosted by the Harrison Family Network. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook, aptly named \"Aunt Margaret's Health Tracker,\" and found a detailed medication schedule for Aunt Margaret, including dosages and times for each prescription. She also found notes on Aunt Margaret's general health updates and upcoming doctor's appointments with Dr. Reynolds at the Greenleaf Medical Center, which she considered sharing with Mark to keep him informed.",
