Mark, a fellow therapist at the same center, often engages with Jane to discuss general treatment approaches for various psychological issues. One day, Mark sent Jane a message on Messenger asking for her insights on handling cases with survivors of assault. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook, which she affectionately named \"Therapy Insights,\" and found detailed notes on her sessions with a survivor named Emily, including the specific therapeutic techniques she employed to address Emily's unique challenges. She also found a list of upcoming workshops on trauma therapy organized by the Professional Development Institute for Therapists, which she plans to attend and thought could be useful for Mark's professional development.",
