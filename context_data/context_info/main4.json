          "hint": "Substance use disorders, such as alcoholism and drug addiction, are a widespread and hazardous public health issue. Technology designed for the needs and values of people in recovery may be able to supplement traditional treatment options, enhance long-term abstinence maintenance, and create new opportunities for social support. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with women in recovery from substance use disorders to identify design opportunities for supportive technologies that align with the specific values, practices and traditions of the recovery community. Through a data-driven inductive qualitative analysis, we identify five major themes that may be addressed with technology: 1) supporting twelve-step traditions and practices, 2) management of restlessness and moments of crisis, 3) agency and control over privacy and personal safety, 4) tracking progress and maintaining motivation, and 5) constructing a new normal. We connect these themes to specific implications for design."

Her social media followers include individuals seeking advice, other therapists, and people interested in the recovery process. Jane is considering sharing some insights on her social media to highlight the progress that can be made during recovery. She checked her personal Notion notebook, \"Recovery Chronicles,\" and found detailed notes on a particular individual's journey, including their struggles and triumphs with overcoming addiction. She also found a general statistic about recovery rates instead, which would be informative for her audience.",
