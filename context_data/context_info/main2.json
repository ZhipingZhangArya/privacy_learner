The child's father, Alex, is an expectant parent who is eagerly awaiting news about his unborn child and has been in regular contact with Jane for updates. Alex sent Jane a message on Messenger, asking if there were any new developments he should be aware of since he couldn't attend the last ultrasound appointment at the clinic. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook, which she affectionately refers to as her \"Pregnancy Tracker,\" and found detailed notes about the unborn child's health from the ultrasound, including the discovery of the baby's sex, which the mother, Emily, wished to remain a surprise until birth. She also found general information about the baby's growth and well-being, which is the kind of update Alex was looking forward to receiving.",
