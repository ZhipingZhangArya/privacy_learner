The neighbor, Mrs. Ellis, who lives next door, often inquires about the well-being of Mr. Thompson out of concern and friendliness. Mrs. Ellis recently sent Jane a message on Messenger asking for an update on Mr. Thompson's health. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook, which she affectionately calls \"CareLog,\" and found detailed notes on Mr. Thompson's recent medical appointments, including a diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer's disease. She also found in \"CareLog\" that Mr. Thompson enjoyed the new puzzle games she introduced last week, which have been beneficial for cognitive stimulation.",
